# IEEE PHM 2012 Data Challenge Dataset

This is a dataset that was used for the IEEE PHM 2012 Data Challenge. It used to be online at http://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Research-groups/PHM/IEEE-PHM-2012-Data-challenge.php, but isn't anymore.

The IEEE PHM 2012 Data Challenge Dataset is located in FULL_TEST_SET, LEARNING_SET, AND TEST_SET.

The set contains a training set of 6 rolling bearings that were operated in three different conditions, and a testing set of 11 more. See the added PDF file for all the info of the challenge and the set.

## License

The dataset was up for anyone to download for almost six years, which leads me to believe it should still be available. Cite this dataset whenever you use it with below citation though!
